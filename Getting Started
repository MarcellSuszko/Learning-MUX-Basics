After watching a few videos, I decided to try my hand at creating a simple 4-1 MUX circuit in MultiSim to get some hands-on experience with them.

However, before even opening MultiSim, I thought it would be wise to create a truth table and a logic (boolean) expression beforehand.

For my select lines, I decided to use S0 and S1 to represent them.
For my inputs, I decided to use I0, I1, I2, and I3 to represent them.
For my output, I decided to use O to represent it.

So, the truth table would look something like this:
--------------
S1 | S0 | Y  |
0 | 0 | I0   |
0 | 1 | I1   |
1 | 0 | I2   |
1 | 1 | I3   |
